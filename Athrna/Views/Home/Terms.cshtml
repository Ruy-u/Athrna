                        <p>Athrna provides a platform that connects users with information about historical and cultural sites in Saudi Arabia and facilitates connections between users and local guides who provide tour services.</p>
                        <p>Athrna does not provide tour guide services directly. Guides listed on our platform are independent contractors, not employees or representatives of Athrna. We facilitate the connection between users and guides but are not responsible for the actions, statements, or conduct of any guides or users of our Service.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="terms-item">
                        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you may need to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
                        <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information as necessary to keep it accurate, current, and complete.</p>
                        <p>Athrna reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.</p>

                        <p>Guides are solely responsible for the services they provide, including tour content, quality, safety measures, and compliance with local regulations.</p>
                        <p>Athrna reserves the right to remove guides from the platform for violations of these Terms, applicable laws, or for receiving consistent negative feedback from users.</p>

You retain ownership of your User Content, but by posting it, you grant Athrna a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, and distribute your User Content in connection with the Service.</p>
